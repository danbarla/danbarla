### Hi there 👋, I'm Dan Barladeanu

[<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="http://github.com/danbarla/danbarla/omscs.jpeg">][3]

I am an OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) student at Georgia Tech.  
I pursue the Computational Percetion and Robotics specialization.

I have been working full time as a computer vision algorithm developer since 2019:
1. Implementing algorithms for real-time vision-aided localization based on three-view constraints in C++ (based on [Link][2]) 
2. Implementing features for 3D image geo-registration algorithms in C++
3. Implementing real time navigation server architecture for aerial platforms in Python 
4. Working with Nvidia platforms such as Jetson Nano, NX and Xavier

Im interested in the fields of Vision-Aided Navigation, SLAM and 3D Reconstruction.

I hold a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering and an MBA with IT focus.
